                <b>Android software development</b> is the process by which applications are created for devices running the
                Android operating system.
            </p>
            <p>
                Google states that "Android apps can be written using Kotlin, Java, and
                C++ languages" using the Android software development kit (SDK), while using other languages is also
                possible. All non-Java virtual machine (JVM) languages, such as Go, JavaScript, C, C++ or assembly,
                need the help of JVM language code, that may be supplied by tools, likely with restricted API support.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some programming languages and tools allow cross-platform app support (i.e. for both Android and iOS).
                Third party tools, development environments, and language support have also continued to evolve and
                expand since the initial SDK was released in 2008. The official Android app distribution mechanism to
                end users is Google Play; it also allows staged gradual app release, as well as distribution of
                pre-release app versions to testers.
